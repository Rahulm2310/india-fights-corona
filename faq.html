              illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are

              The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry
              cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion,
              runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually
              mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t
              develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
              80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
              Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously
              ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those
              with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart
              problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
              People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek
              medical attention.

              People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The
              disease can spread from person to person through small droplets
              from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with
              COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and
              surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by
              touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose
              or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in
              droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales
              droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3
              feet) away from a person who is sick.

              <br />
              For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is
              still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities
              or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or
              visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher.
              Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action
              every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply
              with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large
              gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce
              your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.

              Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially
              for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious
              illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital
              care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how
              the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We
              can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our
              loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these
              actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory
              hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the
              local health authorities including any restrictions put in place
              on travel, movement and gatherings.

              few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different

              Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing
              COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that
              SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed
              virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir
              in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related
              viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs
              isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this
              group, but is less closely related.

              The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through
              droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
              speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They
              quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
              <br />
              You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1
              metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated
              surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing
              your hands
